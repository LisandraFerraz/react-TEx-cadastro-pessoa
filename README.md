# User Register CRUD - FRONT-END

The project allows you to create, read, update and delete user informations.

The goal is to create an API using Nest and integrating it to the front-end, which was done with React.

## Running locally

Fork, install and run the front-end (current) and the API ([available here](https://github.com/LisandraFerraz/nestjs-TEx-cadastro-pessoa)) projects locally with NPM.

```bash
    npm install
    npm run start
```

To use run the back-end, it is necessary to run MongoDB Compass and connect with your local host.
